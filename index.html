                With the demand for programmers at an all time high, I enrolled in UC Berkeley's Coding
                Bootcamp to gain a competitive advantage in everything tech! <br><br>
        
                I have a fluid educational and professional background. My educational background includes a Bachelors in Political Science from San Francisco
                State University culminating in a judicial internship with the Superior Court of California County of San Francisco. Prior to that I was a
                Personal Banker for Wells Fargo Bank for two years before deciding to return to school and complete my degree. Since then I have been a bartender 
                at a high-volume nightclub.<br><br>
                
                Outside of school and work, I like to get away to tropical destinations and spend time with my husband and our infant son. We're hoping to add 
                somemore stamps to our passports before embarking on a career in programming! <br><br>
